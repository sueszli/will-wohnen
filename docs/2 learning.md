this project didn't turn out to be as practical as i thought it would be.

the main reasons are:

-   of how much data is missing from the listings. people are only obligated to state the last_update, price and district - and even then, they are not always accurate (ie. people leaving out missing repair costs that make the apartment unaffordable).

-   people purposefully leave out deal-breaker information in their listings (ie. the apartment already being rented out or the apartment being in a bad condition). just parsing a bunch of weirdly formatted and unstructured text doesn't help with that.

my alternative approach is:

-   to go through the listings and first filter out purely based on the first visual impression.
-   then go through the listings and filter out based on the text by using a multi-highlight extension to highlight the text that i want to stand out (ie. keywords like "repair", "rented out", "bad condition", etc.).

this is surprisingly effective and a lot simpler as well.
