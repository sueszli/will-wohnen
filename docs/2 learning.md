this project doesn't give you an edge in real estate investing, because willhaben doesn't tell the full story:

- the best properties are only accessible to brokers - that's why they're so expensive.
- people lie on ads and leave out important things like: additional mandatory repair costs, whether the apartment is leased for an indefinite period, etc.

so just scraping a bunch of unstructured, incomplete text without any pictures won't suffice to find the top investments.
