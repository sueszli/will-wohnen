this project doesn't give you an edge in real estate investing, because willhaben doesn't tell the full story:

- the best properties are only accessible to brokers - that's why they're so expensive.
- people lie, paraphrase and leave critical details out on ads: additional mandatory repair costs, whether the apartment is leased for an indefinite period, etc.

through this approach, you'll find the top 30% of investments at best and will have to sort the rest out manually.

you'll get much further by just scrolling around and looking at the header pictures, since the majority of them reveal a lot more about the apartments state.
